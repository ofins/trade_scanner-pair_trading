# Pair Trading Strategy Analysis

## Demo Usage

First, we start by running scanner. For this Demo, I am scanning for potential pairs in Tech sector of S&P 500.

![running scanner](./media/image.png)

Here are the list of potential pairs generated. The lower `coint_pvalue` is, the more "cointegrated" the stocks are.

Now I will run a 2 year backtest for a sample pair, CDW-AMD.

Below is one visual representation of how a backtest looks like for `CDW-AMD` pair.

Now I will run backtest for all the pairs listed in the scanner.

_There are several limitations to this backtest._
_It does not properly address scanning for potential pairs on a daily basis during backtest._

## Overview

This project implements and analyzes a **pair trading strategy** to identify potential arbitrage opportunities in financial markets. Pair trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves taking simultaneous long and short positions in two highly correlated securities when their price relationship deviates from the historical norm.

## What is Pair Trading?

Pair trading is based on the statistical concept of **mean reversion**. The strategy assumes that:

- Two historically correlated stocks will maintain their relationship over time
- When the price spread between these stocks deviates significantly from the mean, it will eventually revert
- Profits can be made by betting on this convergence

## Strategy Implementation

### Methodology

1. **Pair Selection**: Identify highly correlated stock pairs using historical price data
2. **Spread Calculation**: Calculate the price spread or ratio between the paired securities
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Determine entry and exit thresholds using:
   - Z-score analysis
   - Rolling mean and standard deviation
   - Cointegration tests
4. **Signal Generation**: Generate buy/sell signals when spreads deviate beyond threshold levels
5. **Risk Management**: Implement stop-loss and position sizing rules

### Key Components

- **Data Collection**: Historical price data acquisition and preprocessing
- **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical correlation and cointegration testing
- **Backtesting Engine**: Historical performance simulation
- **Risk Metrics**: Calculation of Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and other performance metrics

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run scanner
python src/scanner/index.py

# Run backtest for a single pair
python src/backtest/single_pair.py

# Run backtests for all pairs generated by scanner's report
python src/backtest/index.py
```

## Key Findings and Analysis

### Performance Metrics

Our comprehensive backtesting revealed several important insights:

- **Returns**: Strategy showed mixed performance across different market conditions
- **Volatility**: Higher than expected volatility in spread relationships
- **Transaction Costs**: Significant impact on profitability when realistic costs are included
- **Market Regime Changes**: Strategy performance varied significantly across different market cycles

### Statistical Challenges

1. **Non-Stationarity**: Many assumed correlations broke down over time
2. **Regime Changes**: Market structure changes affected historical relationships
3. **Execution Slippage**: Real-world execution costs significantly impacted theoretical returns
4. **Liquidity Issues**: Some pairs exhibited liquidity constraints during volatile periods

## Conclusion

After extensive analysis and backtesting, **we conclude that this pair trading strategy does not provide a reliable edge to beat the market**. Key reasons include:

- **Insufficient Alpha Generation**: Risk-adjusted returns did not consistently exceed market benchmarks
- **Transaction Cost Burden**: Trading costs eroded most potential profits
- **Model Instability**: Statistical relationships proved less stable than historical data suggested
- **Market Efficiency**: Modern markets appear to price pair relationships more efficiently than the strategy assumes

### Lessons Learned

1. **Market Adaptation**: Quantitative strategies face the challenge of market participants adapting to known patterns
2. **Cost Awareness**: Transaction costs must be central to strategy design, not an afterthought
3. **Regime Testing**: Strategies must be robust across different market regimes
4. **Reality Check**: Theoretical statistical relationships don't always translate to practical trading profits
